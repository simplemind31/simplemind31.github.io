    <h2>Bolivian on Paper</h2>

    <p>
      I was born in Bolivia, but my parents are Asian. I look Asian. I speak Chinese. 
      But I have never had Chinese nationality. On paper, I have always been Bolivian.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes I wonder how much of identity is paper, and how much is memory.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I was two years old, my parents sent me to China to live with my grandparents. 
      They had to work in Bolivia. I grew up with my grandparents, my brother, and my cousins. 
      That was home. That was childhood. That was where my first memories were built.
    </p>

    <p>
      I didn't know I was Bolivian.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every once in a while, my parents would take me back to Bolivia to do some documents, 
      and then I would return to China. Bolivia felt temporary. China felt permanent.
    </p>

    <h2>The Sudden Shift</h2>

    <p>
      It wasn't until I was ten or eleven, around 2019, that everything changed. 
      My parents told me I had to stay in Bolivia. Not for vacation. Not for paperwork. To live.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was sudden.
    </p>

    <p>
      New country.<br>
      New language.<br>
      New culture.<br>
      New rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      And suddenly, I was the foreigner.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I arrived in Sucre, I didn't speak Spanish at all. 
      My dad tried to enroll my brother and me into a school. 
      The principal's reaction was simple:
    </p>

    <p>
      “How could your sons enter my school if they don't even speak Spanish?”
    </p>

    <p>
      It wasn't cruel. It was logical.
    </p>

    <p>
      But logic can still make you feel small. It made something clear: I was already behind.
    </p>

    <p>
      So my dad found an institution where we could start learning Spanish. 
      After a few months, he went back to that school, and this time we barely got in.
    </p>

    <h2>The First Day</h2>

    <p>
      I still remember the first day of class.
    </p>

    <p>
      People stared.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not in a violent way. Just curious. Too curious.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Where are you from?”<br>
      “Do you eat with chopsticks?”<br>
      “Do you eat sushi?”<br>
      “How do you say this in Chinese?”
    </p>

    <p>
      It was endless.
    </p>

    <p>
      That was the first time I understood something: 
      I would never be “normal” here. I was different before I even spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you are ten years old, you don't have the language to describe what you're feeling. 
      But you feel it.
    </p>

    <p>
      You realize you are not entering a group.
      You are entering as a category.
    </p>

    <h2>Prejudice Without Vocabulary</h2>

    <p>
      There was a classmate who clearly didn't like us. 
      He used to say things like “chino cochino.” 
      I didn't fully understand the words at the beginning, 
      but I understood the tone. I understood the laughter.
    </p>

    <p>
      What confused me most was this: 
      many of the kids who said Chinese people were dirty were the same ones who didn't even wash properly. 
      Many admired Japanese culture, anime, technology, but somehow “Chinese” was an insult.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why?
    </p>

    <p>
      Why is being Chinese something to mock, but being Japanese something to admire?
    </p>

    <p>
      How can admiration and contempt be separated by geography?
    </p>

    <p>
      How can one Asian identity be romanticized and another reduced to insult?
    </p>

    <p>
      At ten years old, I didn't have the vocabulary for prejudice.
    </p>

    <p>
      I just knew I was different in a way that required justification.
    </p>

    <h2>Social Survival</h2>

    <p>
      When I adapted, when I learned Spanish well enough, when I became the best student in class, 
      something shifted. Grades changed how people treated me. 
      The classmate who used to bother us stopped. 
      Suddenly I was “smart,” not “chino cochino.”
    </p>

    <p>
      That was my first lesson in social survival:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>If you are different, you better be exceptional.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Being normal was never an option. 
      But being successful, that earned respect.
    </p>

    <p>
      Things were better, but not fully normal. 
      I was still “the Chinese guy.” 
      Not just a student. Not just a friend. 
      Something slightly separate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even when discrimination became softer, it never fully disappeared.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Do you eat dogs?”<br>
      “Cats?”<br>
      “Insects?”
    </p>

    <p>
      I used to wonder where these ideas came from. 
      Why would being Chinese automatically mean I eat those things?
    </p>

    <h2>A Permanent Guest</h2>

    <p>
      I don't hate Bolivia. It is my country. 
      It is the only nationality I've ever had.
    </p>

    <p>
      But sometimes I feel like I'm a permanent guest.
    </p>

    <p>
      It doesn't mean I don't have friends. I do. Good ones.
    </p>

    <p>
      But sometimes, even inside a group, I feel slightly outside of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like I'm included, but not fully absorbed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of my friends still joke:
    </p>

    <p>
      “Do you eat dogs?”
    </p>

    <p>
      Or they imitate the stereotype that Chinese people can't pronounce certain letters, 
      replacing L with R.
    </p>

    <p>
      They laugh. And I laugh too, sometimes. 
      Because it's easier to laugh than to explain.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's easier to act like it doesn't matter.
    </p>

    <p>
      And maybe they don't mean harm. 
      Maybe for them it's just humor. 
      But repetition turns jokes into reminders. 
      And reminders turn into distance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bolivian on paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      Chinese by face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Something undefined in practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      In China, I would be the kid who grew up abroad.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Bolivia, I am the Chinese guy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Where do you place someone who doesn't fully match either label?
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe that's why I called myself a “weirdo.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Not dramatically.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just accurately.
    </p>

    <h2>Another Kind of Different</h2>

    <p>
      During my Olympiad journey, I met people who looked like me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Asian face. Latin American nationality.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the first time, I thought: maybe they understand.
    </p>

    <p>
      I imagined we shared the same story, being asked where we're “really” from, 
      being stared at in the streets, being reduced to stereotypes before being seen as individuals.
    </p>

    <p>
      I wanted to talk to them about it. 
      I thought there would be some silent connection.
    </p>

    <p>
      But I was wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were not like me.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the countries they grew up in, there are many Asians. 
      They are not rare. They are not the only ones in their class. 
      They are not constantly reminded that they look different. 
      Their face is just another face.
    </p>

    <p>
      They don't carry the same weight of visibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's when I realized something:
      <strong>it's not just about race. It's about context.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      In Sucre, my brother and I might be the only Asian students in our school. 
      Maybe in the whole area. I've heard there are more in Santa Cruz. 
      But here, we are noticeable. Always noticeable.
    </p>

    <p>
      The strange thing is that I don't feel openly attacked anymore. 
      I'm not bullied. I'm respected academically. 
      People admire my achievements.
    </p>

    <p>
      But admiration is not the same as belonging.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Olympiads, in academic spaces, I feel closer to people. 
      Not because we look the same, but because we think the same. 
      In those rooms, your value is measured by ideas, not by your face.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe that is why I feel those places as home rather than my normal routine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe that's why I felt disappointed when I realized those other Asian contestants 
      didn't share my experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      I wasn't looking for someone who looked like me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was looking for someone who felt like me.
    </p>

    <p>
      And that, apparently, is rarer.
