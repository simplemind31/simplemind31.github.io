<h2>Beginnings</h2>

<p>
I started doing math olympiads in 2022. Back then, everything felt simple in a naïve way: a problem, a pencil, a blank sheet of paper, and time. I didn’t think about teams, international contests, or medals. I just liked the feeling of thinking hard about something and, after struggling for a while, finally understanding it.
</p>

<p>
Little by little, I started getting closer to bigger things. By 2024, I was already part of Bolivian teams for some international math olympiads and competitions. I thought math was “it” for me, until 2023, when I discovered Olympiad in Informatics.
</p>

<h2>Discovering Informatics</h2>

<p>
OI felt different from the very first problems I saw. It still had the depth and rigor of math, but now ideas had to survive contact with reality. You could have a beautiful idea and still fail because of an implementation detail. You had to think, but you also had to build. For me, that combination, problem solving plus code, was fascinating. It felt more alive.
</p>

<h2>IOI 2024 Selection</h2>

<p>
When the selection process for IOI 2024 started in late 2023, I decided to focus more seriously on Informatics. That year, our selection was based on accumulated scores across many contests. There were two “cupo danilo” spots designed for younger or newer contestants, so they could gain experience for future IOIs, and two open spots for the strongest contestants regardless of age or experience (as long as they were not too far into college).
</p>

<p>
I was still quite new to competitive programming. I remember asking Diego, our coach, the same questions again and again:
</p>

<p>
“What is this?”<br>
“Why is this wrong?”<br>
“What am I missing?”
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I felt annoying. Sometimes I felt slow. But looking back, that persistence, and Diego’s patience, taught me an incredible amount. My background in math helped me understand ideas faster, but Informatics forced me to be precise in a way I had never been before.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, I earned a spot for IOI 2024. I remember feeling proud, relieved, and excited, all at once. And then reality hit. IOI 2024 was held in Egypt, and the cost was too high. My dad didn’t want me to go. Bolivia ended up sending only three people that year.
</p>

<h2>OII and Pressure</h2>

<p>
I won’t lie: it hurt. It hurt to earn something and then have to give it up. I still feel a bit sorry for Mati, because technically I took a spot I couldn’t use. At least I was able to participate in OII, the Iberoamerican Olympiad in Informatics. That was my first international OI experience, and honestly, I didn’t do well. I only got an honorable mention.
</p>

<p>
I think pressure beat me there. Some contestants who ranked lower than me in the selection performed better at OII. That taught me something uncomfortable: being “better on paper” doesn’t mean much when nerves take control.
</p>

<h2>OBI and the Long Road to IOI 2025</h2>

<p>
When the others went to Egypt, I stayed behind. I was sad, but I didn’t stop. In late 2024, OBI, our national Olympiad, was approaching, and this time I wasn’t competing with beginners anymore. I trained harder than ever. OBI that year was extremely tight: I finished second, just one minute behind first place. Third place was only a few minutes behind me. For the first time, I felt how cruel and precise time could be.
</p>

<p>
The real beginning of IOI 2025 started in October 2024, when school ended and vacation began. IOI was going to be held in Bolivia, and that changed everything. As hosts, we felt an unspoken responsibility: we had to do our best.
</p>

<p>
Our coach selected the four strongest past contestants to focus on. This didn’t mean we were already in the team, it meant pressure. Contest after contest, problem after problem. Our vacation slowly disappeared into statements and wrong submissions. It was frustrating. I think we all suffered. That year, I almost completely stopped focusing on math olympiads and put all my energy into Informatics.
</p>

<h2>The Training Camp</h2>

<p>
In March, something important happened: after years without one (probably because of COVID), we finally had a training camp. Five contests in one week. Classes. Living together. Eating together. Complaining together. That camp decided the ten Bolivian participants for OII, but more importantly, it made us a team. That one week was exhausting, and unforgettable.
</p>

<h2>Final Selection and Preparation</h2>

<p>
After the camp came the final contest in April. Its results, combined with the camp, determined who would go to IOI. As hosts, Bolivia had eight spots: four official and four unofficial. We all pushed ourselves as hard as we could. When the results came out, I earned a place.
</p>

<p>
Training didn’t stop. In fact, it got heavier. Our coach started simulating real IOIs with past problems. Then, something unexpected happened: about a week before IOI, he stopped giving us problems entirely. He even prohibited us from solving anything for the last two weeks. He told us to rest.
</p>

<p>
Strangely, I felt confident. Not because I thought I was amazing, but because we had already gone through the worst.
</p>

<h2>IOI Week</h2>

<p>
As IOI week approached, Sucre began to feel different. I would see groups of foreigners walking down the street, and I could almost immediately tell they were IOI contestants. They looked scary, not in a bad way, just… smart. My nerves went up every time.
</p>

<p>
The day finally arrived. Since IOI was in Sucre, I just took a taxi to the venue. Suddenly, I was surrounded by people from all over the world. I learned card games, laughed a lot, and slowly forgot about the competition itself. Team 1 shared rooms with Belgium, team 2 with the USA, eight people per room, two countries mixed together. At some point, it felt less like a contest and more like a strange, beautiful gathering of people who loved the same thing.
</p>

<h2>Contest Day 1</h2>

<p>
Then came contest day 1.
</p>

<p>
Two hours before the start, the nerves returned. We sat in front of our computers. The countdown began.
</p>

<p>
10… 9… 8…<br>
3… 2… 1…
</p>

<p>
Keyboards exploded. Pages flipped. Pens moved. I made a mistake right away: I started with problem 1. I spent two or three hours stuck, unable to find a clean approach. Eventually, I moved to problems 2 and 3, tried to squeeze partial points, and returned to problem 1 near the end.
</p>

<p>
When the day ended, I had 116.29 out of 300.
</p>

<p>
Later, a team leader told me something that still hurts a bit: my partial solution on problem 3 (36/100) could have been extended to 86/100 with a simple change. I didn’t even beat 50%. I felt empty.
</p>

<p>
But the rest of the day was different. We played games, solved puzzles from sponsors: Huawei, OpenAI, CodeMao, Tech Arena, Tencent. We collected plushies, pens, shirts, bags… and somehow, happiness. For a moment, I forgot about my score.
</p>

<h2>Between the Days</h2>

<p>
The next day was a tour. In the afternoon, we held the OII award ceremony. Even though we already knew the results, it was special to finally receive the medals. I got silver, so did Gabriel. Mati, Agus and Nestor got bronze.
</p>

<p>
That afternoon, our coach gathered us and said some motivational words for day 2. My teammates looked confident. I didn’t. I cried, I felt useless, I complained about what I could have done on day 1. My best friend (Nico) tried to calm me down, but even on the bus back to the hotel, I was still angry at myself.
</p>

<h2>Contest Day 2</h2>

<p>
Day 2 came. Same breakfast. Same hall. Same countdown. I won’t describe the contest again, the feeling was identical.
</p>

<p>
When it ended, my total score was 207.29 out of 600. I hoped that it would be enough for bronze. Then our leader told me: “Your ranking is the same as your score.”
</p>

<p>
I knew I had failed.
</p>

<p>
Some people congratulated me for breaking Bolivia’s best historical ranking and score. I couldn’t feel happy. My goal was a medal. I was 45 points away. In a perfect world, a world where I fixed that problem 3, it was possible.
</p>

<p>
I think I saw disappointment in my coach’s eyes. That hurt more than my score. I felt like we had failed him.
</p>

<h2>Endings</h2>

<p>
After that, time moved strangely. We played, talked, laughed. The event slowly came to an end. I made friends, real ones, from Belgium, Macau, the USA, and of course, my own team. We loved the same thing. That was enough.
</p>

<p>
That last night, Agustín left quietly with his father. He packed his things without saying much. I don’t think he wanted us to notice. When the door closed, the room felt suddenly smaller, as if something invisible had been taken away. I lay there staring at the ceiling, thinking about how strange it is that you don’t realize something is ending until it already has.
</p>

<p>
I didn’t want to go back home. Not to school, not to homework, not to a routine where no one understands why a wrong idea can ruin your whole day or why a partial score can haunt you for weeks. For the first time, it crossed my mind that this might be my last time living this life, the life of contests, camps, scoreboards, and shared exhaustion.
</p>

<p>
I know my dad. Once I start college, he won’t let me keep traveling for olympiads. He sees it as a chapter that should end. And maybe he’s right. But that night, lying in that room, it felt heavy to accept that IOI 2025 might be my last dance in Olympiad Informatics.
</p>

<p>
The next morning arrived too fast. The room felt emptier than it had a week before. Everyone was packing, folding clothes, checking passports, saying quick goodbyes that felt too small for what we had shared. I wasn’t hungry. I didn’t know what to say. Soon the bus to the airport arrived, and one by one, everyone disappeared. I took a taxi back home, alone, carrying more than just a suitcase.
</p>

<p>
I came back without a medal. But what hurt wasn’t the empty hands, it was leaving a place where I felt understood. A place where people spoke the same language. A place where I belonged without having to explain myself.
</p>

<p>
If this really was my last IOI, then I’m grateful it ended like this. With friends from all over the world. With memories that still hurt when I think about them. With the certainty that, for a moment in my life, I gave everything I had to something I loved.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I didn’t get the medal I wanted.
</p>

<p>
But I got a goodbye worth remembering.
