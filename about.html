    <!-- ===== Why Computer Science ===== -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Why Computer Science</h2>

      <p>
        I have always enjoyed solving puzzles and logical problems because they feel
        like a kind of mental sport. This interest first led me to Math Olympiads,
        where I learned how to think creatively and stay patient when a problem
        didn't make sense at first.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 9th grade, I discovered Informatics, and working with computers became
        another way for me to challenge myself. I noticed that many of the strategies
        I used in math also helped me in programming, which motivated me to explore
        Informatics competitions more seriously.
      </p>

      <p>
        Choosing Computer Science as my first-choice major is simply the next step
        in something I already love. Programming allows ideas to become real systems
        that can impact people's lives. Beyond competitions, I want to contribute
        to a world that becomes more digital every year.
      </p>

      <p>
        For me, Computer Science represents curiosity, creativity, and meaningful
        problem solving. It is the path where I can continue challenging myself
        while building technology that shapes the future.
